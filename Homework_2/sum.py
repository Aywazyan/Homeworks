# Input two integers and print out their sum. Preserve the exact format from
# the examples (e.g. the output should contain exactly three lines)
# Sample Input Sample Output
# 4 5 Ð° = 4
# b = 5
# a + b = 4 + 5 = 9
# 17 8 
# a = 17
# b = 8
# a + b = 17 + 8 = 25

a = (input("Enter first number: "))
b = (input("Enter second number: "))
print(int(a) + int(b))
